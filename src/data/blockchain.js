	{
		question: "What is blockchain?",
		answer: "A decentralized, distributed ledger technology used to record transactions across multiple computers in a secure and tamper-resistant manner.",
	},
	{
		question: "Who invented blockchain?",
		answer: "Blockchain technology was invented by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, as the underlying technology of Bitcoin.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a cryptocurrency?",
		answer: "A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates independently of a central bank. Examples include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a smart contract?",
		answer: "A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller written directly into code. It automatically enforces and executes the terms of the contract when predefined conditions are met.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a consensus mechanism in blockchain?",
		answer: "A mechanism used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems. Examples include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a public blockchain?",
		answer: "A blockchain where anyone can participate, read, or write data to the blockchain. Examples include Bitcoin and Ethereum.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a private blockchain?",
		answer: "A blockchain where only authorized parties can participate, read, or write data to the blockchain. It's often used by enterprises for internal processes or consortiums.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a decentralized application (DApp)?",
		answer: "An application that runs on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and offers greater transparency and security.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a fork in blockchain terminology?",
		answer: "A situation where a blockchain splits into two separate chains due to a change in the protocol or consensus rules. It can result in the creation of a new cryptocurrency.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a token in the context of blockchain?",
		answer: "A digital asset issued on a blockchain, representing a unit of value or ownership. Tokens can represent various assets such as cryptocurrencies, real estate, or loyalty points.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a node in a blockchain network?",
		answer: "A computer that participates in the blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain, validating transactions, and relaying information to other nodes. Nodes can be full nodes or light nodes.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a 51% attack?",
		answer: "A scenario where a single entity or group of entities controls more than 50% of the computational power (hash rate) on a blockchain network. This allows them to manipulate transactions, double-spend coins, or disrupt the network.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a block in a blockchain?",
		answer: "A container for a set of transactions on a blockchain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a chain of blocks, hence the name 'blockchain.'",
	},
	{
		question: "What is the role of miners in blockchain?",
		answer: "Miners are responsible for validating transactions, adding them to the blockchain, and securing the network through computational work (Proof of Work). They are rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency and transaction fees.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a Merkle tree in blockchain?",
		answer: "A data structure used to efficiently summarize and verify the integrity of large sets of data in a blockchain. It is constructed by hashing pairs of data recursively until a single hash remains, known as the Merkle root.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is immutability in blockchain?",
		answer: "The property of being unable to change or alter data once it has been recorded on the blockchain. Immutability is achieved through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a hard fork in blockchain?",
		answer: "A type of fork in the blockchain where nodes running previous versions of the software are no longer accepted by the new version. It results in a permanent divergence from the previous blockchain, creating a new chain.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a soft fork in blockchain?",
		answer: "A type of fork in the blockchain where nodes running the new version of the software can still interact with nodes running the old version. It is backward-compatible and does not result in a permanent divergence.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)?",
		answer: "An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by organization members, and not influenced by a central government. DAOs operate on blockchain platforms.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a block reward in blockchain?",
		answer: "The reward given to miners for validating and adding a new block to the blockchain. It typically consists of newly created cryptocurrency and transaction fees.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is a blockchain explorer?",
		answer: "A tool or website that allows users to browse and search the contents of a blockchain, view transactions, and check the status of addresses or blocks.",
	},
